		<p> Einstein is known for developing the theory of relativity, but he also made important contributions to the development of the theory of quantum mechanics.</p>

		<p>
		 Relativity and quantum mechanics are together the two pillars of modern physics.[3][6] His <i> massâ€“energy</i> equivalence formula <strong> E = mc2 </strong>, which arises from relativity theory, has been dubbed "the world's most famous equation".</p>
		 
		 <p>
		 [7] His work is also known for its influence on the philosophy of science.[8][9] He received the 1921 <ul><b> Nobel Prize in Physics</b></ul>  "for his services to theoretical physics, and especially for his discovery of the law of the photoelectric effect",</p>
		 
		 <p>
		 [10] a pivotal step in the development of quantum theory. His intellectual achievements and originality resulted in "Einstein" becoming synonymous with "genius".[11]</p>
